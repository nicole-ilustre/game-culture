        <h1>About Game Culture</h1>
        <p>
          Digital games have exploded in popularity due to the advent of mobile
          phones and free apps distributed through curated app stores. Unlike
          digital games, the world of board games is prohibitively difficult to
          access due to the absence of free curated distribution like that of
          the app stores. This means most people never experience what the
          incredible world of board games has to offer. Game Culture aims to
          solve this problem by distilling the best of board games into high
          quality free printable public domain games and also offer an
          affordable all-games box.

          Who are we We are a collective of creatives, academics and
          professionals who share a love for board games with a common goal to
          bring the best of board games to the world. Our vision is to be the
          catalyst to ignite a new community of others like us to grow to become
          the 'app store of board games' and empower anyone with an idea to
          distribute their game to the world.

          Democratizing Board Games The board game industry is currently
          analogous to a walled garden. It's so beautiful inside, but only a few
          are able to climb over the high walls. The stones of these walls are
          made of high game price tags cemented together by confusion over which
          games to buy. This is why we decided to take the best board game ideas
          and distill them into easy-to-play games that anybody can try for
          free. This is especially relevant in developing countries where board
          game cafes are becoming exponentially more popular but many citizens
          are not able to afford the games for themselves. By making all of our
          games public domain, anybody can download, share and print our games
          legally.

          Support the industry We like to think of our games as gateways to the
          incredible world of board games. Our goal is that by giving away our
          games, we will spur excitement and inspiration for new players to go
          out and buy the kinds of games that excite them. This is why we put a
          strong emphasis on game recommendations. For example if you
          particularly enjoy our bluffing game, you will find that we have
          recommended all the best bluffing games to consider buying. The more
          we support the industry as a whole, the more we all grow.

          Printing and Quality One of the big reasons to buy a real game from
          the store is the nicely designed box, cards and game components. This
          makes a real difference and gives players a much better gaming
          experience than if you were to print a game on normal paper. This is
          why we've put a very strong emphasis on our game art and encourage
          that local print shops produce the games to achieve a near-identical
          experience to buying a game from the store.

          Our All-in-one Game Box For people who want all of our games
          professionally produced without the hassle of printing themselves, we
          offer our all-in-one games box which contains all 15 of our games
          conveniently packaged into one small affordable box. This innovative
          game box makes the ideal purchase for anyone who wants to try all the
          best types of games out there without spending much time and money. It
          also makes an ideal gift! This box has been produced with premium
          components and represents the very best playing experience for those
          who don't want to compromise (it also makes the perfect travel game
          box). We realized that it's not necessary to have a bookshelf full of
          expensive bulky games when we can design in such a way to reuse the
          same components for multiple games. The money earned from this product
          also goes towards our cause to help continue bringing more exciting
          games to the world.
